# Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations
# in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
# print(5+3)
#Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

# Addition
print(6 + 2)

# Subtraction
print(13 - 5)

# Multiplication
print(4 * 2)

# Division
print(32 / 4)
