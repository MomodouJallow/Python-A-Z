# Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
# Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite
# number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print
# each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few
# friends and get some actual data for your program.
