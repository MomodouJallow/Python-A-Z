# Do the following to create a program that simulates
# how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
# Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
# Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or
# two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
# Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already
# been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
# new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
# that the username is available.
# Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
# 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of
# current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
